# RASM Macro
 The RASM macro is a declarative macro meant to recreate [RASM](https://github.com/Thepuppetqueen57/rasm).

 This won't be a 1 to 1 recreation of the original RASM because that would be annoying.

 But I'll try making it close to it.

 Also I will mainly work on the original RASM but I'll try working on this too.
